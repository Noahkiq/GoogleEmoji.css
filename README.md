# GoogleEmoji.css  
Replaces the standard Discord emotes with Google Emojis.

## Usage  
Using this .CSS requires a Discord modification, such as [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord). Simply add this to your .CSS file to install:  
`@import url(https://rawgit.com/Noahkiq/GoogleEmoji.css/master/GoogleEmoji.css);`  
Note that the Emoji Picker does not contain the edited emojis due to Discord using a spritesheet for the emoji picker. This might be fixed one day but I currently don't have plans to do so.
